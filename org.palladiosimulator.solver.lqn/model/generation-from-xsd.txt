The ecore file was created by importing the LQN xsd file as described by the 
"Generating an EMF Model using XML Schema (XSD)" Tutorial (Last updated: May 21, 2008)

Then, the following manual changes were made
* renamed LqnCore to lqn in the root element (name and nsPrefix)
* changed ns URI of this lqn element to "http://palladiosimulator.org/Solver/LQN/2.0" and the prefix to "org.palladiosimulator.solver"
* in lqn.genmodel: renamed LqnCore root element to Lqn (property prefix, then file extension was changed automatically, too)
* in lqn.genmodel, set base package of Lqn to org.palladiosimulator.solver
* in lqn.genmodel, set file extension to .lqxo (as .lqn is interpreted as a textual file by lqns as default and .lqxo is the file extension used as default output by lqns) 

Added manually
* bottleneckStrength attribute in ecore file (with annotations for XML)
