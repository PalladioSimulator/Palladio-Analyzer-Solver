The ecore file was created by importing the LQN xsd file as described by the 
"Generating an EMF Model using XML Schema (XSD)" Tutorial (Last updated: May 21, 2008)

Then, the following manual changes were made
* renamed LqnCore to lqn in the root element (name and nsPrefix)
* changed ns URI of this lqn element to "file:/C:/Program Files/LQNSolvers/lqn-core.xsd"
* changed all other occurrences of "Program%20Files%20(x86)" to "Program Files" except in lqn.xsd2ecore model by searching the whole workspace for that string
* in lqn.genmodel: renamed LqnCore root element to Lqn (property prefix, then file extension was changed automatically, too)
* in lqn.genmodel, set base package of Lqn to org.palladiosimulator.solver
